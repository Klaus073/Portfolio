      "description": "Ekho is an AI-driven project in the Sales domain. The Ekho platform is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to train sales agents through interactive voice-based conversations. Developed using Python and Large Language Models (LLMs), the AI agent simulates real-world sales scenarios, enabling agents to practice and hone their communication skills in a controlled environment. The platform utilizes voice-to-voice prompts to create a highly engaging training experience, making it an effective tool for companies aiming to improve their sales team's performance. In addition to the AI training agent, the platform includes comprehensive user management features. A unique link can be generated, allowing multiple users to join the platform and participate in training sessions. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on personas, which represent different customer profiles used in training scenarios. The platform also supports essential account management functionalities, including login, registration, password reset, and recovery processes. Key deliverables included Backend. The solution uses Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS. Target platforms: Web, iOS, Teams.",

The project creates novels of different genres with AI, allowing multiple inputs for novel settings such as characters, backgrounds, synopsis, chapters, and context.
